# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CS50 Mashup project update. Created database for zipcode file and finished up the articles function.

**Thoughts:** Nothing overly difficult today. Pretty straight forward getting the function to return the news list in the right format. Tomorrow should continue reading about the FTS seaches in SQLite3 so I can increase the search functionality. Good first day. Keep it up, Bruh. 

**Link to work:** Everything is available in the CS50 IDE for right now. May start updating files individually. Not sure how that will work moving forward. 


### Day 2: September 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent a lot of my time today trying to understand virtual tables in sqlite3. I think I finally have them remotely figured out so that I can quickly search all columns when utilizing the search function.

**Thoughts:** Need to spend a bit more time coding then I did today. Tomorrow will work on fully implementing the search function with the newly created virtual tables.

### Day 3: September 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Search functionality is up and working. Individuals can find locations on the google maps (US based only). 

**Thoughts:** Good work today. Definitely need to start reading in my spare time the YDKJS books so I can get a better handle on that stuff.

### Day 4: October 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added markers to the map, and updated removeMarker functionality so that you can move and find new cities. 

**Thoughts:** Right now I'm having an issue displaying the articles on each of the markers. I somehow need to implement jQuery so that on 'click' the markers will display the info of the articles function. I need to look into accessing the data in a JSON response. Spent a while reading about it today and should have a better grasp on it tomorrow hopefully.

### Day 5: October 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Huge day today on the Mashup problem. Managed to finish everything up. Implemented a custom marker for the cities on the map. Created list of articles that populate upon interacting with a marker. All systems go. 

**Thoughts:** On to the final week of the CS50 coursework. The final thing left to do for the course now is the final project, which I'm not really sure what that should be. I think what I'd like to do is start moving forward with my learning so that I'm not dragging my feet trying to come up with a project.
