# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CS50 Mashup project update. Created database for zipcode file and finished up the articles function.

**Thoughts:** Nothing overly difficult today. Pretty straight forward getting the function to return the news list in the right format. Tomorrow should continue reading about the FTS seaches in SQLite3 so I can increase the search functionality. Good first day. Keep it up, Bruh. 

**Link to work:** Everything is available in the CS50 IDE for right now. May start updating files individually. Not sure how that will work moving forward. 


### Day 2: September 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent a lot of my time today trying to understand virtual tables in sqlite3. I think I finally have them remotely figured out so that I can quickly search all columns when utilizing the search function.

**Thoughts:** Need to spend a bit more time coding then I did today. Tomorrow will work on fully implementing the search function with the newly created virtual tables. 

**Link to work:** Everything is available in the CS50 IDE for right now. May start updating files individually. Not sure how that will work moving forward.
