# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CS50 Mashup project update. Created database for zipcode file and finished up the articles function.

**Thoughts:** Nothing overly difficult today. Pretty straight forward getting the function to return the news list in the right format. Tomorrow should continue reading about the FTS seaches in SQLite3 so I can increase the search functionality. Good first day. Keep it up, Bruh. 

**Link to work:** Everything is available in the CS50 IDE for right now. May start updating files individually. Not sure how that will work moving forward.
