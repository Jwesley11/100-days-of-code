# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CS50 Mashup project update. Created database for zipcode file and finished up the articles function.

**Thoughts:** Nothing overly difficult today. Pretty straight forward getting the function to return the news list in the right format. Tomorrow should continue reading about the FTS seaches in SQLite3 so I can increase the search functionality. Good first day. Keep it up, Bruh. 

**Link to work:** Everything is available in the CS50 IDE for right now. May start updating files individually. Not sure how that will work moving forward. 


### Day 2: September 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent a lot of my time today trying to understand virtual tables in sqlite3. I think I finally have them remotely figured out so that I can quickly search all columns when utilizing the search function.

**Thoughts:** Need to spend a bit more time coding then I did today. Tomorrow will work on fully implementing the search function with the newly created virtual tables. 

**Link to work:** Everything is available in the CS50 IDE for right now. May start updating files individually. Not sure how that will work moving forward. 

### Day 3: September 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Search functionality is up and working. Individuals can find locations on the google maps (US based only). 

**Thoughts:** Good work today. Definitely need to start reading in my spare time the YDKJS books so I can get a better handle on that stuff.

### Day 4: October 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added markers to the map, and updated removeMarker functionality so that you can move and find new cities. 

**Thoughts:** Right now I'm having an issue displaying the articles on each of the markers. I somehow need to implement jQuery so that on 'click' the markers will display the info of the articles function. I need to look into accessing the data in a JSON response. Spent a while reading about it today and should have a better grasp on it tomorrow hopefully.

### Day 5: October 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Huge day today on the Mashup problem. Managed to finish everything up. Implemented a custom marker for the cities on the map. Created list of articles that populate upon interacting with a marker. All systems go. 

**Thoughts:** On to the final week of the CS50 coursework. The final thing left to do for the course now is the final project, which I'm not really sure what that should be. I think what I'd like to do is start moving forward with my learning so that I'm not dragging my feet trying to come up with a project.

### Day 6: October 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Been reading through the Git Basics today, so that I can try to understand how to use this system a bit better. 

**Thoughts:** CS50 is all done, except for a final project. I don't know what I want to create for that yet. Going to move on to reading and taking notes on the YDKJS books tomorrow. 

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 7: October 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started on the YDKJS series. Made it through Chapter 1/conditionals and am taking notes. Being sure to write about WHAT I learned from the readings as I go.

**Thoughts:** So far everything seems to be stuff that I've actually already looked at. Need to go ahead and get a bit further before I start learning some new stuff. 

**Link to work:** I'm going to work on creating a repository that has a markdown file of the notes that I'm taking as I'm reading. For now, the notes are simply living in Sublime. 

### Day 8: October 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Crushed the rest of chapter 1.

**Thoughts:** Basic stuff, review thus far. Excited to get into Chapter 2.

### Day 9: October 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Moving through chapter 2 of YDKJS B1. Leaving off on 'Equality' section.

**Thoughts:** Starting to get into a deeper knowledge and understanding of javaScript itself. Taking some good notes on what I'm actually learning as I read through.

### Day 10: October 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing equalities, and starting to get into the idea of scopes and how they impact variables. Hoisting is an interesting concept that I didn't know about. Also very briefly began reading about the 'Strict mode' which seems like a great way to ensure you're writing proper code. 

**Thoughts:** Keep on trekking.

### Day 11: October 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up YDKJS B1. 

**Thoughts:** So much learning to do. Moving onto the next book tomorrow, which is going to be difficult. I have a decent understanding of scope, but the whole closure thing is definitely new to me. Excited to continue the learning. LETS GO BRUH.
